# You are given two positive integers a and b.
#
# In one move, you can change a in the following way:
#
    # Choose any positive odd integer x (x>0) and replace a with a+x;
    # choose any positive even integer y (y>0) and replace a with aâˆ’y.
#
# You can perform as many such operations as you want.
# You can choose the same numbers x and y in different moves.
#
# Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain b from a.
# It is guaranteed that you can always obtain b from a.
#
# You have to answer t independent test cases.
